# github desktop
So I use Github Desktop to keep track of changes. https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop

You'll first want to CLONE this repo, and when you've done changes COMMIT them and then PUSH to the repo. 
Try to only make changes to the respective html/css pairs to avoid complications (for the map I've created map.html and map.css and games has games.html and cards.css) -- the css files can all go into one file technically, but this is likely easier to learn. styles.css has global formatting like text size.

# tutorials
I'd suggest doing codeacademy for HTML and CSS tutorials-- honestly like most coding things, there's loads of forums.

For card flipping, here is a tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp just with CSS (this is why I made a cards.css file)
